# MTDLGC
A dynamic LGC (DLGC) network is proposed to learn the dynamics of spatial weightings by explicitly considering the temporal correlations of spatial weightings at different times of the day. A multi-temporal DLGC (MT-DLGC) network is developed for end-to-end forecasting of traffic variables in road networks.
