# MTDLGC
ConvGNNs have been widely applied in traffic forecasting applications. How to select a suitable spatial weighting scheme for ConvGNNs, however, remains challenging, given the complicated spatial dependencies of traffic variables in real road networks. In this study, we propose a novel ConvGNN, termed learnable graph convolutional (LGC) network, which learns spatial weightings between a road and its k-hop neighbors as learnable parameters in the spatial convolutional operator. A dynamic LGC (DLGC) network is further proposed to learn the dynamics of spatial weightings by explicitly considering the temporal correlations of spatial weightings at different times of the day. A multi-temporal DLGC (MT-DLGC) network is developed for end-to-end forecasting of traffic variables in road networks.
